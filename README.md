# PHP Closure Scope Bug

This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in PHP related to variable scope within closures. The `bug.php` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.php` provides the corrected version.  The issue arises from improper handling of variable scope when accessing variables from the parent function within a closure.  The README explains the problem and its solution.
